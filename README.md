## Semantic Segmentation using Unet from scratch and pre-trained models
In this work, I am going to do semantic segmentation by using the Cityscapes dataset. I used the following two techniques to achieve this.

1. Own Model: In the first technique I am designing the Unet architecture and training it from scratch using the given data
2. Pre-trained Models: In the second technique, I am going to use pre-trained models such as Unet, DeepLabV3+, SegNet, and VGG
